## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch.
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people who have contributed to expanding this template!

## Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Here are a few examples:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenGL
- C++

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
